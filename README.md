# ipumsr-psu-api-workshop

This repository hosts the presentation files for the presentation on ipumsr and 
the IPUMS data extract API given as part of the workshop "Using APIs for 
Population Research," hosted by the Penn State Population Research Institute, 
April 11, 2022. This presentation was originally forked off of the presentation 
in [gergness/ipumsr-tcrug](https://github.com/gergness/ipumsr-tcrug) created by 
Greg Freedman Ellis.

A PDF version of the slides is in "ipumsr_webinar.pdf". The HTML version of the
presentation in "ipumsr_webinar.html" was built from the R Markdown file
"ipumsr_webinar.Rmd" using the R package
[xaringan](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/xaringan.html).
