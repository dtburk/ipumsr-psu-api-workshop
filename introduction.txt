Thanks to everyone for joining us today, and thanks to Scott for organizing this
workshop and inviting us to talk about "Enhancing reproducibility with the IPUMS
API and the ipumsr package." Before getting to the IPUMS API, we will provide
some helpful context in terms of what data are available from IPUMS, how to
create a data extract without the API, and quick introduction to some of the key
functionality of the ipumsr package.

All the materials for this presentation, including a PDF version of these 
slides, will be available on GitHub, and we'll share the link after the 
workshop, so you shouldn't feel the need to take extensive notes. We should have 
time at the end of our presentation for some Q&A, but you can also put questions 
in the chat during the presentation and one of us will try to answer or add them 
to a list to discuss at the end.

With that, we'll get started by briefly introducing ourselves.
